        <h2 class="text-success">Blood donation</h2>
        <p>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. There are several types of blood donation. Each type helps meet different medical needs.</p>

        <h2 class="text-info">Why it's done</h2>
        <p>You agree to have blood drawn so that it can be given to someone who needs a blood transfusion.

        Millions of people need blood transfusions each year. Some may need blood during surgery. Others depend on it after an accident or because they have a disease that requires certain parts of blood. Blood donation makes all of this possible. There is no substitute for human blood â€” all transfusions use blood from a donor.</p>

        <h2 class="text-danger">Risks</h2>
        <p>Blood donation is safe. New, sterile disposable equipment is used for each donor, so there's no risk of getting a bloodborne infection by donating blood.

        Most healthy adults can donate a pint (about half a liter) safely, without health risks. Within a few days of a blood donation, your body replaces the lost fluids. And after two weeks, your body replaces the lost red blood cells.</p>
